# EmployeeManager

This is a demo employee manager project, using MERN stack. The goal of this project was to simulate an employee manager application and to practice.
You can fill up the database with mock data (see below), so you can try out all the features. It is still in an early phase, and it is open for future improvements.

# How to run the project

# Frontend

- Navigate to the client folder
- npm install
- You can start the front end with npm start

# Backend

- Navigate to the server folder
- npm install
- Change the .env file to a valid mongodb url
- npm run populate (to fill up the database with mock employee data)
- npm run dev
